/**
 * BST Successor Search

In a Binary Search Tree (BST), an Inorder Successor of a node is defined as the node with the smallest key greater than the key of the input node 
(see examples below). Given a node inputNode in a BST, youâ€™re asked to write a function findInOrderSuccessor that returns the Inorder Successor of inputNode. 
If inputNode has no Inorder Successor, return null.

         / \ 
        5   12
           /  \ 
         11    14

input = node 11
output = node 12

input = node 9
output = node 11

input = node 14
output = node 20
